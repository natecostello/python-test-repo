    "\n",
    "Steinberg assumes simply supported boundary conditions on all board edges for calculating the stress in the resonant condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dynamic bending stresses in a uniformly loaded PCB can be determined for the resonant condition by considering a sinusoidal load variation for the dynamic load over the board surface when the edges of the board are simply supported. This follows from the relative dynamic deflections, which will be maximum at the center of the board and zero at the edges (Fig. 6.17).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the derivation, I believe the equation for maximum bending moment (eq 6.53) is only valid if a > b, since it assumes the bending moment is greater along the shorter plate dimension $b$ i.e., along the Y axis.\n",

    "- $Q = \\sqrt{f_n}$ (Equations 8.10 and 9.52)\n",
